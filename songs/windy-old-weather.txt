W:(Chorus)
W:It was windy old weather, stormy old weather,
W:When the wind blows, we all pull together.
W:
W:We sighted a herring, the king of the sea,
W:Says "Now, old skipper, you cannot catch me."
W:
W:We sighted a mackeral with stripes on his back,
W:"Time, now, old skipper, to shift your main tack."
W:
W:We sighted a conger as long as a mile.
W:"Wind's blowing easterly," he said with a smile.
W:
W:We sighted a plaice that had spots on his side,
W:Says "Now, old skipper, these seas you won't ride."
W:
W:I think what the fishes are saying is right.
W:We'll haul in our nets and we'll make for the Light.
