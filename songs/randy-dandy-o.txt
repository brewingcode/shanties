# Now we are ready to sail for the Horn
# Our boots an' our clothes, boys, are all in the pawn

# Soon we'll be warping her out through the locks
# Where the pretty young girls all come down in their frocks

# Come breast the bar bullies heave with a will
# Soon we'll be rolling her down through the bay
