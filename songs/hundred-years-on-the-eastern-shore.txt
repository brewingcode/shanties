A hundered years on the eastern shore
Oh yes, oh
A hundered years on the eastern shore
A hundered years ago

I went to sail across the sea
Oh yes, oh
My love said she'd be true to me
A hundered years ago

I promised her a golden ring
Oh yes, oh
She promised me that little thing
A hundered years ago

Oh Bully John from Bolton Moor
Oh yes, oh
I knew him well that son of a hoar
A hundered years ago

Oh BUlly John i knew him well
Oh yes, oh
But now he's dead and gone to hell
A hudnered years ago

I thought i heard the skipper say
Oh yes, oh
Just one more pull and then belay
A hundered years ago-o!
