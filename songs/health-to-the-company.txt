W:My friends and companions, come join me in rhyme
W:Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine
W:Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain
W:For we may or might never all meet here again
W:
W:Chorus:
W:So here's a health to the company and one to my lass
W:Let's drink and be merry all out of one glass
W:Let's drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
W:For we may and might never all meet here again
W:
W:Here's a health to the wee lass that I love so well
W:For her beauty in Ireland, there is none can excel
W:There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits upon my knee
W:Sure there's is no one in in this wide world as happy as me
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock
W:I wish her safe landing without any shock
W:and if ever I should meet you by land or by sea
W:I will always remember your kindness to me
W:
W:Chorus
