From Liverpool to Frisco, a-roving I went
And to stay in that country was my good intent
But drinking strong whiskey like other damn fools
Well I soon got transported back to Liverpool

{Chorus}
And it's roll, (Roll!) roll bullies, roll!
Them Liverpool judies have got us in tow

For forty-two days we were hungry and sore
And the wind was against us and the waves they did roar
Off Battery Point we dropped anchor at last
With our jibboom hove in and the canvas all fast

{Chorus}

The boardinghouse master was off in a trice
He was cursing and promising all that was nice
Well, one old fat crimp, he got cottoned to me
And says he, "You're a fool, lad, to follow the sea."

{Chorus}

Says he, "There's a job and it's waiting for you â€”
Get boatloads of liquor and there's not much to do.
Oh, what do you say, lad, and will you jump to?"
And says I, "You old bastard, I'm damned if I do."

{Chorus}

But the best of intentions they never get far
After forty-two days knockin' back at the bar
Well, he bought me some liquor, and what do you think?
Well, the dirty old bastard put drugs in my drink!

{Chorus}

So come all you young sailors, take warning by me
Keep an eye on your liquor when the whiskey is free
And pay no attention to runner or whore
Or your heart will be sick and your head will be sore

{Chorus x2}
