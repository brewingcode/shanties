W: Well, Elcid Barrett cried the town
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: For twenty brave men, all fishermen, who
W: Would make for him the Antelope's crew
W:   (chorus) "God damn them all..."
W: The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
W: And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
W:   (chorus)
W: On the King's birth-day we put to sea
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: We were ninety-one days to Mon-tego Bay
W: Pumping like madmen all the way
W:   (chorus)
W: On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
W: With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight
W:   (chorus)
W: The Yankee lay low down with gold
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: She was broad and fat and loose in stays
W: But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
W:   (chorus)
W: Then at great length we stood two cables away
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: Oour cracked four-pounders made an awful din
W: But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
W:   (chorus)
W: The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
W: And the main-truck carried off both me legs
W:   (chorus)
W: So here I lay in me twenty-third year
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: It's been six years since we sailed away
W: And I just made Halifax yesterday
W:   (chorus)
